- [] - Hi Vusal. Regarding your question, you can create an app to create an opportunity and to ease the process of learning and also you can put there prep questions for people who want to get enough knowledge to study bachelorâ€™s degree. In the future, you can also put questions for teacher candidates to ease their burden and even enter into B2G by working with government, I believe they would also support you since you are trying to create opportunities for foreigners to get interested in your country, which will lead to income growth and investments in your country + you're improving the quality of education here
